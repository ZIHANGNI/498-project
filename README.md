# Generating Synthetic Climate Data with Deep Learning

## Overview  
This project explores the use of deep learning techniques to generate synthetic climate data conditioned on geographic coordinates. The goal is to create realistic temperature and rainfall patterns for regions with limited or no weather station data. 

By leveraging historical climate records, the model learns spatial dependencies and climate variations, providing valuable synthetic data for climate research, risk assessment, and environmental analysis.
